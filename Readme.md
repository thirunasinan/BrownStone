## Get a Local Instance Running

### install postgres
install homebrew : http://brew.sh/

install postgres with homebrew :

`brew install postgres`

create initial database :

`initdb /usr/local/var/postgres`

### download codebase
`git clone git@github.com:marcellosachs/brown.git`

Code is now in the directory `brown` within the current working directory.

### install gems
`cd brown`

`bundle install`

### set up application database
`bundle exec rake db:create`

`bundle exec rake db:migrate`

### download production data
`heroku pg:pull HEROKU_POSTGRESQL_BLACK_URL brown_development`

### start local server
`rails s`

## Deploy to Production
`heroku git:remote -a boiling-island-42431`

`git push heroku`

## Admin CMS
The [Admin CMS](https://boiling-island-42431.herokuapp.com/admin) is generated by [rails_admin](https://github.com/sferik/rails_admin) using a [config](https://github.com/marcellosachs/brown/blob/master/config/initializers/rails_admin.rb).

## Technical Suggestions Going Forward

Use [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) or [browserify](http://browserify.org/) so we can use the node package module system on the front end.

I recommend [React on Rails](https://github.com/shakacode/react_on_rails) as a way to get webpack set up (includes automatic set up of react, redux, and es6).

Once node package modules are available on the front-end, it would be good to start using [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux) to manage application state on the front end.

It might also be a good idea to split the app into several independent apps that communicate with the main app through an API. This would allow development to proceed more independently. The smaller apps could be :

* [Admin app](https://boiling-island-42431.herokuapp.com/admin)
* [Problem Uploader](https://boiling-island-42431.herokuapp.com/problems_parser)
* [Problem Tagger](https://boiling-island-42431.herokuapp.com/problems_tagger)
* [Problem Viewer](https://boiling-island-42431.herokuapp.com/problems)
* Student UI (not yet built)

As far as Data communication between client and server systems, I recommend Facebook's [graphql](https://code.facebook.com/posts/1691455094417024) ([tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNPVqK_woRQ)) and [relay](https://facebook.github.io/relay/)
